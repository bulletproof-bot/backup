# bulletproof backup

Back up your AI agent. Track changes over time. Rollback when things go wrong.

## What it does

Your agent changes over time — skills get added, personality drifts, memories accumulate. This tool captures snapshots so you can:

- **See what changed** — Git-based versioning shows diffs between any two points in time
- **Roll back** — Restore your agent to any previous state
- **Export anywhere** — Your cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, S3), your data

## What gets backed up

- Skills and capabilities
- Soul file (personality definition)
- Conversations and memories
- System prompts
